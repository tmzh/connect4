# Connect4

Simple implementation of connect 4 game in Python. 

## Running in CLI
Run `board.py`  to run the CLI form of the game. Player 1 and 2 take turns to specify the column in which disc should be dropped. The script prints a CLI representation of the game.

```shell
python board.py
```

## Running GUI
Run `connect4.py` to run the visual form of game. It is written using PyGame.

```shell
python connect4.py
```
